        <h2>Wanna know how to roast asparagus? Well, let's do it!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>
                <p>This recipe calls for olive oil cooking spray, but you can easily grease your casserole dish with regular ol' olive oil.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Asparagus</strong>
                <p>Buy plump, firm asparagus stalks with tightly closed tips. The color should be vibrant and unfaded, while the stalks should be roughly the same size for even cooking.
            <li><strong>Parmesan</strong>
                <p>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese is best, but pre-shredded will work in a pinch.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Sea Salt</strong>
                <p>Opt for a coarse sea salt for the best results. Kosher salt will work if that's all you have on hand.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Garlic Powder</strong>
                <p>Just a pinch of garlic powder adds bold, herbaceous flavor to this Parmesan-topped roasted asparagus.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray the inside of a 9x13 casserole dish with olive oil cooking spray. Place asparagus in the dish and lightly spray spears with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle asparagus with Parmesan cheese, sea salt, and garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Roast in preheated oven until fork easily punctures thickest part of stem, about 12 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
